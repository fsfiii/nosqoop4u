nosqoop4u

A sqoop-like jruby/jdbc query application that does not run via map/reduce.
It supports direct output to HDFS and unix filesystems as well as STDOUT.

Requires jruby 1.6+.

- Why write this?  What's wrong with sqoop?

Nothing is wrong with sqoop.  It just doesn't do quite what I need and
it's not so straightforward to debug when something goes wrong.  In
addition, my Hadoop cluster does not route beyond an access layer which
means I need to create individual db-specific firewall rules in order to
use sqoop.

Also, I wanted a nice opportunity to play with jruby's java interop
and here I get to use both the JDBC and Hadoop HDFS APIs.  On a side
note, I'm blown away by jruby 1.6.2...stellar performance and an
elegant seamless integration with java.

# installation

jgem install --no-wrapper nosqoop4u

Or simply copy nosqoop4u.rb and nosqoop4u into your path.
